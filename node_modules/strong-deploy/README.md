# strong-deploy

Deploy a node application package to the StrongLoop process manager, strong-pm.

Both git branches and npm packages can be deployed. They will typically be
prepared using [strong-build](http://github.com/strongloop/strong-build).

For more details, see http://strong-pm.io.


## Installation

`sl-deploy` is made available through the
[strongloop](https://github.com/strongloop/strongloop) tool as `slc deploy`, and
works well with the StrongLoop Process Manager,
[strong-pm](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-pm).

`sl-deploy` can be installed standalone with:
