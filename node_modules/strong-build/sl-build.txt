usage: %MAIN% [options]

Build a node application package.

With no options, the default depends on whether a git repository is
detected or not.

If a git repository is detected the default is `--git`: install and commit the
build results to the "deploy" branch, which will be created if it does not
already exist.

If no git repository is detected the default is `--npm`: install and
pack the build results into a `<package-name>-<version>.tgz` file.

Options:
  -h,--help       Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version    Print version and exit.
  -n,--npm        Same as `--install --pack`.
  -g,--git        Same as `--install --commit`.
  -i,--install    Install dependencies (without scripts, by default).
  -s,--scripts    If installing, run scripts (to build addons).
  -p,--pack       Pack into a publishable archive.

Git specific options:
  -c,--commit     Commit build output (branch specified by --onto).
  --onto BRANCH   Branch to commit build results to, created if
                  necessary ("deploy", by default).
