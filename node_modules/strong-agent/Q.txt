average: 0.4
maximum: 20
  WTF?

debug: broken, requires DEBUG to be set, which is stupid

reporting frequency is: 15 sec

http metrics are delayed by two periods, why?

for gauges, the values are sticky in statsd... this is not good, agent is not
integrating well with statsd

bunyan: should figure out how to recommend it for loopback, and how it should
be configured



1) Can I monitor how many requests/second are currently being fielded on
average and what's the peak load?

  ... NO

2) Can I monitor and determine which are the longest running requests?

  ... NO

3) Once I start ... can I monitor and determine, if my loopback server ever
crashed or hung for a while ... as the incoming requests either queued-up or
got rejected due to timeout, at its gates?

  ... NO

  exits, known by pm, should be published as a metric
    expected vs unexpected is also known

  http requests incomplete: known, unreported

4) Can I monitor and determine: On average how long does a request/response
take? 200ms, 5 seconds?

  ... YES
