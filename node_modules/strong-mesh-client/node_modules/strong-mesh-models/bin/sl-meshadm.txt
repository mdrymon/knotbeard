usage: %MAIN% [options] [command ...]

Administration of the Strongloop Central server.

Options:
  -h,--help               Print help and exit.
  -v,--version            Print version and exit.
  -C,--control CTL        Control endpoint for process manager.

The control endpoint for the process manager is searched for if not specified,
in this order:

1. `STRONGLOOP_PM` in environment: may be a local domain path, or an HTTP URL.
2. `http://localhost:8701`: a process manager running on localhost

An HTTP URL is mandatory for remote process managers, but can also be used on
localhost. If the process manager is using HTTP authentication
then valid credentials must be set in the URL directly, such as
`http://user-here:pass-here@example.com:7654`.

When using an HTTP URL, it can optionally be tunneled over ssh by changing the
protocol to `http+ssh://`. The ssh username will default to your current user
and authentication defaults to using your current ssh-agent. The username can be
overridden by setting an `SSH_USER` environment variable. The authentication can
be overridden to use an existing private key instead of an agent by setting the
`SSH_KEY` environment variable to the path of the private key to be used.


Executor commands: apply to a specific executor hosts

`EXEC` is the executor ID. It can be obtained by listing executors using
`executor-list`.

  executor-create [DRIVER]   Create an executor, and provides an authentication
        token which the executor uses to contact the Central server.

  executor-remove EXEC       Remove an executor EXEC.

  executor-list              List executors registered with the Central server.
